Core primitive types known by js and ts

- number => 1, -1, 2.2
- boolean => true, false
- string => "hello"

Key diff between ts and js

- js uses "dynamic types" (which means they get resolved at runtime)
- ts uses "static types" (which means they are set and fixed during development)

What is type inference? 

- A feature of ts whereby it is able to determine the type of a variable or constant based on the assigned value

The core job/task of typescript is checking types and yelling at us if we are using them incorrectly

JS has no compilation step but at runtime, you can check for certain types (e.g. in if conditions). 
TS on the other hand allows you to catch certain errors during development since it checks types during compilation as well.

Object types

- Used to describe the type of an object
- Eg 
  const person: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  } 

  Array types

  let hobbies: string[]
  hobbies = ["cycling", "swimming"]
